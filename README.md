‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing.

Prerequisites
You must have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

Install project dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:
Create a file named .env.local in the root of your project and add the following Supabase credentials. You can find these in your Supabase project settings.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

For local development with the Next.js framework, it's also a good practice to define your Vercel URL in your local environment variables.

NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=https://your-vercel-app-url.vercel.app

(Replace the placeholders with your actual Supabase and Vercel URLs.)
